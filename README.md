# What this branch do?
In this branch, I made some changes to the original Fight or Flight mod to make the mod more interesting.  
It's my first time to participate in the development of a mod so something may not go smoothly as I had expected.
## Changes
- Added a multiplier so that you can multiply the level of the pokemon when calculating its aggresion.
> (It was quite annoying to use this mod with the Cobblemon Mass Outbreaks mod because the outbreak happens all of a sudden and most of these pokemon are aggressive,so they just keeps hitting you until you defeat them all.)  
- Added a multiplier so the speed stat of a Pokemon can influence their speed when chasing a target or fleeing.(can be changed in the config)  
- The pokemon can now teleport to a nearby position if it learns the teleport move and got panicked.(can be disabled in the config)
- Added a range attack for pokemon whose Sp.ATK is higher than its ATK.
- If a pokemon has some special moves,they will shoot different bullet.
- - The power of these moves will influence the damage of the projectile.However, if your pokemon doesn't have these moves there is also a base value(60 by default) .
## TODO
- Give more special effect to different moves.
- Integrate the power of the pokemon's move more deeply into the calculation of the pokemon's damage to make the mod more immersive.
