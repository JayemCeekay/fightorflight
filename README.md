# What this branch do?
In this branch, I made some changes to the original Fight or Flight mod to make the mod more interesting.  
It's my first time to participate in the development of a mod so something may not went smoothly as I had expected.
## Changes
- Add a multiplier so that you can multiply the level of the pokemon when calculating its aggresion.
> (It was quite annoying to use this mod with the Cobblemon Mass Outbreaks mod because the outbreak happens all of a sudden and most of these pokemon are aggressive,so they just keeps hitting you until you defeat them all.)  
- Add a multiplier so the speed stat of a Pokemon can influence their speed when chasing a target or fleeing.(can be edited in the config)  
- The pokemon can now teleport to a nearby position if it learns the teleport move and got panicked.(can be disabled in the config)
## TODO
- Add a range attack for pokemon so that the pokemon won't use their special attack to perform a melee attack.
- Integrate the power of the pokemon's move into the calculation of the pokemon's damage to make the mod more immersive.
